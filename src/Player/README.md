# Player Library

The responsibiity of the Player library is to play
selected anime episodes.

When called the Player class will receive a URL which
it will open with a web browser and play the episode.

To simplify implementation, it is assumed that the URL
being sent is for Anime Twist.

Functions to pause, resume, skip episode, see previous 
episode are also available.
